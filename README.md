A Minecraft Resource Pack

---
### ABOUT

This resource pack changes several mods in Minecraft 1.18 and 1.19 to be more like similar mods from 1.7 and 1.12.

The Aether -> The Aether II: Genesis of the Void (Portal + Sounds, Music (Although it is not time-dependent), White Flowers and several other changes, like the bronze dungeon stones and Slider boss)

ProjectE -> Equivalent Exchange III (Philosopher's Stone, Alchemical Fuels)

QuarryPlus (AdditionalEnchantedMiner) + Refined Pipes -> Buildcraft (Quarry)

Backpacked (MrCrayfish) -> TheMightyPork's Backpack Mod

Advent of Ascension (Not changed to be like a different mod, just the Crystallite Sword was changed to the older, tri-blade design that, at least to me, is iconic, although it might not be to everyone)

---
### OTHER CHANGES:

This resource pack also includes some small tweaks for the following mods:

LongFallBoots (Textures updated to match Minecraft's new artstyle from 1.14)

The Aether (A few small changes other than just changing it to be like the Aether II)

ProjectE (A few small changes other than just changing it to be like Equivalent Exchange III)

## IMPORTANT FOR IF YOU ARE USING THE AETHER MOD:

If you are using this with the Aether mod, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY reccomend that you use the resource pack

'Jappafied Aether(s)' by Aerod and BrianIsBro (and the 1.19 textures addon, which can be found in the packs folder of JAPPAFIED AETHERS (not Reforged), which is in the same folder as the assets folder).

Please note that the version for Minecraft 1.19 (which also works in 1.18) has not been released on Curseforge yet, but can be downloaded from their Github page:
