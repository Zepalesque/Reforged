A Minecraft Resource Pack

---
### ABOUT

This resource pack changes several mods in Minecraft 1.18 and 1.19 to be more like similar mods from 1.7 and 1.12.

The Aether -> The Aether II: Genesis of the Void (Portal + Sounds, Music (Although it is not time-dependent), White Flowers and several other changes, like the bronze dungeon stones and Slider boss)  
https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether

ProjectE -> Equivalent Exchange III (Philosopher's Stone, Alchemical Fuels)  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte

QuarryPlus (AdditionalEnchantedMiner) + Refined Pipes -> Buildcraft (Quarry)  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/additional-enchanted-miner

Backpacked (MrCrayfish) -> TheMightyPork's Backpack Mod  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/backpacked

Advent of Ascension (Not changed to be like a different mod, just the Crystallite Sword was changed to the older, tri-blade design that, at least to me, is iconic, although it might not be to everyone)

### OTHER CHANGES:

This resource pack also includes some small tweaks for the following mods:

LongFallBoots (Textures updated to match Minecraft's new artstyle from 1.14)  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/long-fall-boots

The Aether (A few small changes other than just changing it to be like the Aether II)  
https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether

ProjectE (A few small changes other than just changing it to be like Equivalent Exchange III)  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte

Magnum Torch (Textures updated to match Minecraft's new artstyle from 1.14, also please note that this is _not_ the Torchmaster mod, although I may add some textures  for that in the future also)

## IMPORTANT FOR IF YOU ARE USING THE AETHER MOD:

If you are using this with the Aether mod, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that you use the resource pack  
'Jappafied Aether(s)' by Aerod and BrianIsBro.
Please note that the version for Minecraft 1.19 (which also works in 1.18) has not been released on Curseforge yet, but can be downloaded from their Github page:

https://github.com/AerodDev/Jappafied-Aethers

Also, I recommend using the Tallgrass config and Pink Aercloud config when using this resource pack with the Aether.

Additionally, I am currently developing an addon mod for the Aether which will include most of this resource pack.
