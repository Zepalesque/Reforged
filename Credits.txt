Gilded Games (The Aether II: Highlands): Aether Portal texture and Sounds

Refined Mods (Refined Pipes): the models from older refined pipes versions (modified)

SinKillerJ (ProjectE): The sound of transmuting a block with the Philosopher's stone (modified)

Aerodd and BrianIsBro (Jappafied Aether): Several textures for the Aether Mod (some modified, some rearranged)

All other assets were made by me (Zepalesque). Some were based on other textures, but other than shape, I made them from scratch
